# Flex Message Example

All customized cards in this line bot are created using [Flex Message](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/messaging-api/using-flex-messages/).
These can be created easily using the [Flex Message Simulator](https://developers.line.biz/flex-simulator/) provided by LINE.

In `example.json`, three keys are defined on the first level.

Each of the keys is the specific text the user has to enter in their chat room in order to obtain the card.

* `return` - 
    The key `return` is the text the user has to provide in order to retrieve the previous message. The value does not correspond to any Flex Message.
* `home` - 
    This corresponds to the `Home` Flex Message. 

* `about` - 
    This corresponds to the `About` Flex Message.

## Testing

Type the following command below under this directory to test `example.json`
```shell
$ mv example.json data.json
```

## Creating your own Flex Message

}
```
